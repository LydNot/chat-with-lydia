Part Two will be about why people avoid specialization.¹\n\nif you usually lurk, consider subscribing; i email <2x/year\n\n1. Competence\n\na. Intrinsic Cost\n\nWhile working on the\n\nSvR gap\n\n, I ran into a simple unpleasant observation:\n\nIf SvR coherence is actually a dangerous capability—i.e. a move that increases loss-of-control risk—then I should be cautious about pushing it.\n\nRight now, I get to be curious because I’m small. My experiments are micro-scale, within the ambient research distribution. Nothing I do is out-of-distribution enough to bear real moral load.\n\nBut if that changed—if I started doing more robust or decorrelated things—I’d inherit obligations I currently avoid. And I can feel the incentive to\n\nnot\n\nlet those conditions change, because I like the freedom I have.\n\nThat’s the pull of amateurism.²\n\nb. Opportunity Cost\n\nCompetence tightens the constraint set. Becoming actually good implies a heavier burden of evaluation: what I do, why I do it, which trajectory i’m nudging. That trades directly against curiosity.\n\n2. Recognition\n\nI currently open-source almost everything—drafts, experiments, stray thoughts. I don’t worry about being scooped; if someone copies me, they know who originated it; that’s enough. The rewards of sharing freely / openly are so high.³ Besides, I have more ideas than I know what to do with, and it’s a blessing to see someone else did ‘my thing’—that means I can move onto more exciting things! I really enjoy inhabiting this fearless mindset, and want to continue doing so.\n\nBut if I became more original\n\nor\n\nmore visible, the calculus flips. A larger audience amplifies impact, which increases the cost of mistakes, which pressures the mind to regularize what it produces.\n\na. Moderating what you post\n\nIf your reach grows, every post inherits latent second-order effects: what you normalize, what you inadvertently prototype for others, the degree to which you shape the field’s priors. This creates a subtle incentive to cap audience size—stay amateur, protect freedom.\n\nb. Moderating what you allow yourself to think\n\nThe deeper danger: thought-space collapse. Public thinking creates an internal critic that optimizes for legibility.\n\nGavin\n\nonce warned me: “public intellectuals can become hostages to their audience.” It’s easy to end up with tamer thoughts, prematurely rounded edges, a mind optimizing for scrutiny instead of exploration.\n\nhow much intellectual privacy is optimal?\n\nConclusion\n\nCompetence and visibility both erode intellectual freedom because the\n\nopportunity cost landscape sharpens\n\n. Once your moves matter, the tradeoffs stop being hypothetical.\n\nIf I stay an amateur, let’s not pretend it would be for freedom.\n\nX explains Z% of variance in Y\n\n. When I avoid running an experiment, some mixture of {X₁: dispositional inertia⁴, X₂: intrinsic-cost aversion, X₃: opportunity-cost pressure⁵} is doing the work.\n\nThis piece tries to expose that structure and commit, in public, to choosing competence + responsibility anyway.\n\n¹ subjective-lifespan effects; more in part two.\n\n² very AI-safety-specific; sometimes i think about how to avoid this.\n\n³ transparency fights insularity harder than secrecy fights “being scooped.”\n\n⁴ sometimes i do things before understanding them just to defeat X₁.\n\n⁵ occasionally at the cost of skipping a robustness check."}

The MLP experiments finished super quickly:\n\nthe data processing inequality is ‘violated’ :( see how layers 2-4 eventually overtake layer 1! except that knowledge about MLPs is itself data.\n\nThese results make sense. The information is ‘all there’ (though unusable) in layer 1. The later layers learn usable information over time.\n\nThe RBM experiment took longer. At some point we looked and nvidia-smi showed GPU utilization at 0% (😱), but in fact this was to be expected!\n\nAfter 2h 17mins\n\n1\n\n, the RBM finished:\n\nThis suggests that you can’t infer much about digit class from an RBM’s hidden units. But did the RBM itself actually infer anything about digit class? I forgot to actually get digit classification accuracy of the trained RBM, and did not save its weights :), so am quickly re-training and will edit this post with digit classification accuracy once I have it. (I predict low!)\n\nReally, I should’ve implemented a ‘denoising thermodynamic model’, which  which consists of 2-8 Energy-Based Models (EBMs) sequentially chained together. DTMs were just\n\nused\n\nto achieve 10 000x energy efficiency improvement over GPU-run diffusion models on Fashion-MNIST.\n\nThe RBM itself is just one special case of\n\nIsingEBM\n\n:\n\nI’ve tried to replicate DTM, and will set that running once the H100 frees up. My replication might not work, in which case I have a backup plan:\n\nThanks Som Bagchi for pair programming!\n\n1\n\nlater sped this up with larger batch size"}

I’m writing to you from\n\nLighthaven\n\n. In fact, I’m using voice dictation. I’m using an app called\n\nSuper Whisper\n\nto dictate this into my laptop.\n\nThe reason I am dictating to you is because I would like to spend substantial portions of the next month writing code. In particular, I would like to try using Tinker from Thinking Machines to do some fine-tuning. However, it is very difficult for me to find time for this when I am under pressure to write 500 words each day.\n\nTaking Stock\n\nI am very happy about the more technical and object-level posts I have written. “The K-values of Speculative Kinship” is probably my favorite piece.\n\nI am also very happy with “Defending the Data Processing Inequality” and “The Bitter Lesson: Six Years On”.\n\nI have gotten enough positive feedback on “Two Types of Homeostasis” and “Should AI companies become profit-maximizing firms?” that I am now proud of these two.\n\n“Lit review: Stated vs. Revealed preferences in LMs” and “The Non-Perishable Agenda” feel like important reference pieces.\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nIn terms of what’s next—I have\n\ntranscribed\n\n20 Neurotech Pub podcast episodes using OpenAI Whisper and have been reading through these to answer various questions that I have about neurotechnology and neuromodulation. Neurotechnology seems like a field where tacit knowledge is extremely important. So I do think that reading 40 hours of podcast transcripts might be one of the best ways to understand the frontier.\n\nHowever, it takes a lot of effort to turn this material into posts. I also want to write about state space models, but there are\n\nseveral\n\npapers\n\nI need to read to make that happen. I have also promised a series on the Bitter Lesson, and I am very enthusiastic about continuing this series, but these posts take time.\n\nI am likely to collaborate with\n\ncondu.it\n\nto write about their thought-to-text system. I am very excited to let the world know about their work!\n\nThere are, of course, more casual posts that I can write. I have been considering writing “\n\ncurius.app\n\n: An Enthusiast’s Review”. There are also the posts on my\n\nManifold Market\n\n. It feels as though I have been mining my backlog of conceptually simple posts over the past few days, and that things will only get more difficult as the month goes on. This is why this evening, I am attempting to dictate 17 posts so that I have enough backup posts to cover the rest of Inkhaven, and can participate in freer intellectual exploration across the rest of the month. Thank you for bearing with me!\n\nCamera roll to hit word count\n\nmy friend is making an SF bingo card\n\nnear Essex Woods…\n\n…just outside Boston\n\nre “The K-Values of Speculative Kinship”\n\ntoronto, unlike in the movies\n\nhow you know you’re approaching campus\n\nthe walls of lighthaven\n\ngo follow andrew! he has a great post coming :D\n\nflights of fantasy\n\nmy blog!\n\nBy Andrew Wu"}

But it could hold you back.\n\nI once talked to an Ivy League student group organizer who didn’t know a classmate from their college who published with GPI and went to work at OpenAI.\n\n5\n\nThis seems like one case where the ICs and the student group organizers were pretty distant, with the ICs doing higher-leverage things.\n\nIf you’re a student doing or considering the IC path, please get in touch! We should map and live in interest-space. If 2+ people message me, I’ll make a group chat for people explicitly focused on prioritizing this path. (which I would then have to either leave or put an AI in charge of(?), because anything else would make me an AIS student group organizer, which I have no interest in being).\n\n1\n\nNote that you can swap out ‘AIS’ for ‘EA’ in most of the above and it stands, or indeed many other group types.\n\n2\n\ne.g.\n\nPathfinder\n\n, fellowship for AIS student group organizers ft. funding, mentorship, & community, or OASIS, the workshop for AIS student group organizers. These initiatives have\n\nshifted\n\nfrom OP to Kairos. I’m glad they exist!\n\n3\n\nIf an org like OP/Kairos wanted to gather the ICs, I tentatively think that could be cool & boost the number of people following the path, but also maybe outside the spirit of the thing. Non-student-specific, domain-specific gatherings ought to be sufficient.\n\n4\n\nAlso, if you’re saving time not wrangling venues and budgets and Airtables, you may develop enough expertise to become a mentor in one of these programs.\n\n5\n\nnot leopold, another one"}

You could train an LLM on dataset-method pairs without giving it access to this decision tree. How long would it take to re-derive the tree?\n\nThis decision tree can, after all, now be used to create a vast amount of ‘causal inference’ synthetic data.

I have\n\nDoneThat\n\nand\n\nRescueTime\n\nrunning.\n\nIf available at a reasonable price point, I’d buy wearables that track my every move. I’d like insights into which actions work really well for me. All kinds of latent variables (e.g. hydration) influence cognition and focus.\n\nNow that causal inference is ~mostly automated, great opportunities await the first startup to do comprehensive passive data tracking and return the highest-leverage interventions to help you achieve your goals.\n\nCausal AI Scientist as case study in benchmark response\n\nCausal AI Scientist hit SOTA on:\n\nCauSciBench, a real-world benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to perform causal analysis on tabular datasets.\n\nA benchmark operates like a ‘pull incentive’ / irresistible challenge for researchers to perform well on it. Or (more realistically) researchers look at problems they could address, find one with a suitable benchmark, and end up investing more time and energy into it. As previously discussed:\n\nA lot of the hard work seems to be coming up with environments where success matters.

I’m back on the plane—which means another ‘catch-up’-style post.\n\nOxford Equilibrium: A Two-Slope Optimal Timing Problem\n\nFriends have noticed I’ve pushed back Oxford graduation a couple of times by now. First, I changed course PPE -> MathPhil; then, I rusticated, & have been roaming around America since. 2025 -> 2026 -> 2027.\n\nI love my studies; I really do. When I started them, the world looked very different: GPT-3 Playground iirc. You couldn’t find a good LM to fluently discuss course material with for love nor money. ChatGPT came out in March 2023–moreover, GPT-4 did. It wasn’t a game-changer for me back then. These days, it’s the personalized tutor I didn’t know I needed. I arrived at Oxford with a hell of a lot of gaps. I didn’t close them quickly, in part because I opted into an alienated-hermit type of existence: I didn’t attend a lecture at the Mathematical Institute until the second year of my mathematics degree. But LMs kept improving all this time.\n\nNow\n\nthey’re good enough to discuss topology with me–including in Voice Mode, which I’ll write another post advocating use of at some point.\n\nI think I’m getting better at math faster than LMs are improving. One might be tempted to push back another year, s.t. they can properly accompany me through functional analysis. But–there’s a competing gradient to consider!\n\nOxford is getting hotter, & each summer exam season is less bearable than the last\n\nOK, so that’s\n\ntrue\n\ngiven global warming & lack of A/C. Thermal regulation is a genuinely decision-relevant problem–you will\n\nnot\n\nwant to be there in 2030. It’s no Singapore.\n\nBut OK, there might be more interesting & general effects to consider in the course of this essay.\n\nConsider:\n\nOpportunity cost of being in school rises as you can do more with AI outside it\n\n‘# of years to use skills for good’ decreases as we approach full automation\n\n‘# of years to enjoy being mathematically competent / expressing yourself with math’ decreases as you approach the year of your own death\n\nWhatever’s driving the competing curve–sensible intellectual/professional considerations or, let’s be real,\n\nit getting too damn hot in Oxford–\n\nwe can model equilibrium timing like this:\n\nThis is especially relevant at colleges that allow several years of leave. The learning experience is likely to become more joyous as AI technology improves, so if learning certain material is a ‘bucket-list wish’, consider balancing the benefits of delaying with the costs of having less time to enjoy wielding, being shaped by, & expressing yourself through that knowledge.\n\nMy Favorite Equilibrium\n\nThe Malthusian model of [orchard]\n\nDuncan\n\nonce asked “What’s your favorite equilibrium?”\n\nAt [orchard], we had a set weekly snack budget. $50/week, I want to say?\n\nAttendance\n\nvaried\n\n—from ~10 to ~40.

For a post I put a lot more of myself into, go to yesterday’s :):\n\nHere are today’s thoughts:\n\nBe selectively decorrelated\n\nsleep at 2am! be a winter MATS fellow! but—be intentional about it\n\nOne great joy in life is doing things slightly off-cycle from everyone else.\n\nI often sleep pretty late. Many night owls appreciate the peace & quiet darkness brings. It’s easier to work when your inbox isn’t filling with daytime demands. It can also be easier to access facilities—showers, printers, library space, etc..\n\nTaking time off college is similarly fun. I’ve preferred the San Francisco Bay Area during fall / spring, when everyone’s dedicated to projects they care about year-round, vs. during summer intern season.\n\nI had a lovely day one ESPR staying back in the common room while 95% of camp went out on a puzzle hunt.\n\nHowever, when you get used to being off-cycle, you might overlook what you’re missing by doing it. Sometimes it really is worth getting up early to sing in harmony with everyone else.\n\nSince I got a handle for ‘acting decorrelatedly’, I can just note when I’m leaning into it and check whether that’s the right call. Yesterday, I went to the beach on my own and realized it hadn’t been. Fortunately I saw the rest of the group and rejoined them :)\n\nJoin inaugural cohorts\n\nHere are some inaugural cohorts I’ve really enjoyed participating in:\n\nPolaris Fellowship\n\nNow\n\nOdyssey\n\nRise\n\nCBAI SRF\n\nInkhaven\n\nWhat you’ll notice during an inaugural cohort is that the organizers are often\n\nreally receptive\n\nto feedback. They also tend to be cool and entrepreneurial—they’re bootstrapping their vision; later, they’ll find someone to hand it off to. You’ll have a lot of fun hanging out with them.\n\nYou also get to play an active role in shaping the experience for later cohorts!\n\nThis is something I thought sounded like a ‘consolation prize’ when I went through the UWC selection process (UWC: 18 colleges with founding dates ranging from 1962 to 2019). I was pretty happy to get placed at LPCUWC (b. 1992), because I thought the experience would be a well-oiled machine, and I’d make lots of alumni friends. In practice, I haven’t spoken much to alumni, and based on my personality I probably would’ve had more fun at a brand-new college where staff and students are equally new to everything.\n\nBesides, the inaugural cohort generally gets the best treatment:\n\nThere are exceptions; YMMV.\n\nRaise your baseline\n\nSet your ‘fallback’ pretty high\n\nI wear boots every day. If I buy trainers / sandals and keep them by the door, I’m going to wear those more and more. So I don’t.\n\nA few days ago, my fallback post was a meta ‘Living Better’ post. But I want my lazy posts to be paper summaries / ones through which I learn, not yapping. The day after, I made my fallback a quick overview of a paper and some of its implications, which felt better. Unless in exceptional circumstances (traveling), I’ll set my bar for lazy-posts higher."}

I asked how such off-the-scale / naïvely-\n\nincommensurable\n\ncosts could be internalized.\n\nHe started to reply:\n\nWell, companies should be able to use the surplus from profits (which ideally reflect value provided to society) to pay for insurance (that provides coverage for costs they might impose on society).\n\nI asked what % of their budget AI companies might need to spend on insurance. Couldn’t costs spiral out of control quickly for small companies developing general-purpose models?\n\nIf they have to spend so much on insurance, mightn’t this preclude altruistic endeavors, e.g. giving students free access (as Google does)?\n\nWhy do you think they give students free access? Is it altruistic?\n\n(Gosh, I’m naïve and San Franciscan)—\n\nIt is not! They are profit-maximizing firms.\n\nAre they?\n\nFirst, I’m not sure that they literally are. It seems PBCs like OpenAI and Anthropic are at most mission-constrained profit-maximizers.\n\nThen there’s the more interesting question—should they be?\n\nI started to distinguish between two schools of thought:\n\nTreat AI developers as\n\nprofit-maximizing firms\n\n, force them to internalize externalities through liability regimes, use government subsidies to support innovation, and let markets take care of everything.\n\nan illustration of world #1\n\nTreat AI developers as\n\npublic-interest entities\n\n. Don’t impose expensive liability regimes: the AI companies can’t afford it, because they aren’t capturing all the surplus they provide (and nor should they).\n\nSteelmaning treating AI companies as profit-maximizers\n\nSay we’re considering requiring AI companies to buy expensive insurance.  Treating AI companies as profit-maximizers—responsible for capturing all surplus they provide to society—favors it: the company can take care of itself (and shouldn’t be around if it can’t). Treating AI companies as public-interest entities introduces ambiguity: the company can plead mission to dodge liability.\n\nTreating AI companies as profit-maximizers allows us to\n\nexplicitly\n\nquantify the size of the liability and the size of the subsidy—rather than\n\nimplicitly\n\nsubsidizing risk (by avoiding too-onerous liability regimes).\n\nI am contra paperwork but drawn to making things more explicit.\n\nIs it realistic?\n\nI think, if I were a decision-maker at an AI company, it would be very hard for me to act in consistently profit-\n\nmaximizing\n\nways. But the law student I talked to thought maybe this is unusual. Is it?\n\nI’d like to say typical economic literature applies less because people aren’t so easily bought and sold in this market. You can’t build superintelligence without the right research leads; there are <100 sufficiently skilled research leads, and many of them are driven by non-financial motivations: they won’t just go to the firm that pays highest. Hence we cannot explicitly\n\nor\n\nimplicitly (through imposing costs that price out public benefit entities) model AI developers as profit-maximizers and call it a day.\n\nWhich considerations seem salient to you?"}

Outflows & inflows. I have a soft spot for each edge on this graph. Writing in public pulls the three nodes into tighter alignment.\n\nTwo Types of Homeostasis\n\nI think many people think they’re doing well in life when they get good exam scores, get into good colleges, graduate from those colleges, and so on. I think this basically holds for people from the most challenging backgrounds but does not hold otherwise.\n\nHere is doing nothing at all:\n\nHere is following the default trajectory for people of your reference class:\n\nThese are the two types of homeostasis.\n\nI do not know why someone with Oxbridge-educated parents would be happy to get into Oxbridge. You are simply doing what has been done before.\n\nHere was my reaction:\n\nThough not part of that group, it was priced in.\n\nThe fun part is that you can change your reference class—and with it, default baseline expected trajectory. You’re on a new trajectory once a scholarship invests in you. Can you outperform again? Generate the excess returns (not just financial) needed for sustainability of the program? Outperform your reference class?\n\nHomeostasis might look like this if enough people invest in you:\n\n(pictured: dollar, hourglass, brain—representing inputs of money, time, mentorship)\n\nThere’s a question of what we owe our investors, and I think we owe them outperformance.\n\nYou outperform by finding your calling and pursuing it with fervency and artisanship—when incentives are aligned."}

Then Karpukhin et al. said “let there be word embeddings”, and\n\nDPR\n\n-style single vector encoders were born. Khattab & Zaharia saw this was good, and hit SOTA by saying “let us learn and compare token embeddings”.\n\n1\n\nColBERTv2\n\nreinforced the dominance of this approach.

(2020)\n\nTitle: “wav2vec 2.0: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning of Speech Representations.”\n\nInitially, we took raw audio waveforms and extracted their Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, then fed these into a Hidden Markov Model in which each state corresponded to a sub-phoneme.\n\nwav2vec 2.0\n\nobsolesced that: we let the CNN learn its own latent speech representations, then let the transformer learn its own context representations (\n\nwhich correspond to human phonemes\n\n!) as we train it using contrastive loss.\n\nLater,\n\nAudio Spectrogram Transformer\n\nwent convolution-free and purely attention-based, removing CNN-based priors and allowing patch embeddings to attend to each other, like in Vision Transformer.\n\nField: Model-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nAuthors: Hafner et al.

This can be expressed concisely as ‘post-processing cannot increase information’.\n\nWho’s challenging it? Why?\n\nConcisely:\n\nXu et al.\n\n1\n\npoint out that with infinite computation, we can compute plain text from encrypted text. Plain text t(X) and labels Y have higher effective mutual information than encrypted text X and labels Y.\n\nPimentel and Cotterell\n\n2\n\npoint out that the representations learned by BERT are more helpful for downstream models than raw sentential data. Contextualized representations f(X) may provide higher extractable information about targets Y than raw input X.\n\nWhy do I think this is missing the point?\n\nI think this is basically factual. But I also think information sneaks into the equation through selecting which processing function to use.\n\nTake Pimentel and Cotterell’s ‘proof by counterexample’. In it, they use a distribution Z defined by f(y) = y - θ, where data points y are sampled from Poisson distribution Y, and θ is the true (unknown) mean of that underlying distribution Y. They then show that Z = f(Y) is more useful to a Bayesian agent than Y. Ergo, the data processing inequality does not hold.\n\nBut true mean θ is salient information that a Bayesian agent would not have access to! Similarly, in the example of Xu et al.—a Bayesian agent can’t recognize which of the many gibberish outputs from brute-force decryption\n\nis\n\nplain text without\n\nsome\n\nexternal data about the target language. Moreover, this agent must use procedural knowledge about how to perform algorithmic brute-force decryption.\n\nThen, in the overarching case of learned representations—these are learned from so much data! Can you then abstract that data away, use the function, and claim to have broken the data processing inequality?\n\nEvery processing function must be learned. And almost certainly a lot more data is used to learn them than the data points they’re ultimately applied to, which are the only ones represented in the equations of these authors.\n\nIn these papers, we get the processing functions for free. But learning the processing functions is the hardest and most interesting task for these Bayesian agents. Researchers should not elide this important detail.\n\nI have high uncertainty because I am not trained in this field, so I appreciate corrections, different frames, and more literature recs on the topic.\n\n1\n\nSection 3.2,\n\nA Theory of Usable Information Under Computational Constraints\n\n2\n\nSection 3.4.2,\n\nA Bayesian Framework for Information-Theoretic Probing"}

Should we prioritize aligning…\n\nRevealed to stated (in the vein of\n\nmodel spec stress-testing\n\n)\n\nOr stated to revealed (in the vein of\n\nintrospection\n\n/ metacognition / self-modeling / CEV)? (This feels more interesting).\n\nIf the gap is closed, the model should be able to self-model and understand its volitional dynamic more accurately. I don’t have a strong theory of how to make this differentially safe rather than dual-use, which is keeping me up at night right now (or would if I thought this research more consequential than the exploratory, in-the-water first steps that it is right now).\n\nKeen to hear thoughts on approaches to try—and more than anything, how this kind of thing (model consistency) fits into the overall alignment story.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(one side: consistent models bad, more powerful & still not understood properly. the other: consistency would bring a lot of advantages, in terms of auditing (maybe) & more trustworthy decision-making / bounded self-reports)"}

I showed it to\n\nAustin\n\n, whose feedback was “minor edits, but otherwise good to go!”\n\nI wasn’t satisfied and went back to the drawing board. One week later, I had a significantly more polished draft. I showed\n\nthis\n\nto Austin and his feedback was “hmm…I think I liked the first version better!”\n\nNow, when I reread, I too prefer the first version. Readers do get a lot of value out of half-formed notes—see e.g.\n\nrepresentative Guzey drop\n\n.\n\nSince then, I’ve been trying to publish my initial forward-pass more often.\n\nI want to do lots of technical writing…\n\nI read lots of ML papers, and I want to write about these—ideally including notes from follow-up experiments. I get lots of value from reading others’ paper summaries, so I’m happy to put more out into the world.\n\nThese will live under the\n\nAI/ML tab\n\n(I considered setting up another publication, but I think tags work for now. The content is what matters).\n\nAlso, since\n\nBeware the Delmore Effect\n\n, I’ve become more…open-minded. This means there might be indulgent detours into other technical topics as well:\n\nHow much compute would it take to simulate humans at varying levels of granularity? (inspired by Type-0 risks in\n\nVWH\n\n)\n\nWhat actually is going on in neuromodulation?

I’ll offer to scribe people’s thoughts that haven’t made their way into the world yet. If you know anyone there who might appreciate or benefit from this, please let me know!\n\nI’ll spend 6-10 Nov in the Boston area and 10-11 Nov in Toronto. I may yet be persuaded to visit more of Canada (discovering Canadian AI research (Mila, Vector Institute, UAlberta(!)) has been exciting recently).\n\nOn slow days, there’ll be more personal posts\n\nHere are some in the works:\n\nReal life doesn’t come with dependency conflict warnings\n\nTwo types of homeostasis\n\nDo you love your field or yourself?\n\nReducing your susceptibility to infohazards\n\nThree weird, replicable social moves\n\nTier list of things postponed to post-singularity\n\nWhy people resist specializing\n\nThe Nonperishable Agenda\n\nYou can email me at hello@lydia.ml to vote for any of these :) I have also set up a\n\nmarket\n\nwhere you can vote on which is most likely to happen (and, by doing so, increase the likelihood that it does).\n\n(Betting ‘yes’ on all, then holding me to it, is probably easy money!)\n\n…the Delmore Effect strikes\n\nagain\n\n.\n\nSee you more often :)"}
{"prompt": "Write a blog post titled 'Field Notes from EAG NYC':", "completion": "The Brittleness Problem\n\nI don’t think I can work on LM behavior much longer. It’s too brittle, fickle, sensitive to hyperparameter perturbations—outputs stochastic in a way even\n\nScherrer et al.\n\ncan’t resolve. A grad student resonates; that’s why he’s working on\n\nknowledge graphs\n\nnow.\n\nWhich Way, Scientist AI?\n\nThe\n\nScientist AI\n\npeople don’t seem to have ready answers to “how will Scientist AI expand its database / propose experiments & get them approved?” I perceive two defensible positions here:\n\nWe can still get almost all the value we’d get from agentic / autonomous AI (scientific breakthroughs, poverty alleviation…) with non-agentic / scientist / oracle AI.\n\nWe’re going to be leaving a lot of potential value on the table [by refusing agentic / autonomous systems], but we have no choice but to make this sacrifice.\n\nThey don’t make clear which position they’re defending.\n\nI of course want to see more people defend 1. But if 2 is our only option—if ‘Scientist AI’ is as far as we can go\n\n1\n\n—then I’m interested in how we can set standards that prepare us for Scientist AI, so it can do its darn best with a semi-static / slow-moving database.\n\nRory\n\nsays AlphaFold only worked because all protein-folding researchers used\n\nProtein Data Bank\n\nin the 1980-90s, yielding abundant standardized training data.\n\nWhat standards can scientific conferences set today to help non-agentic AI readers?\n\nSome ‘Scientist AI’ co-authors I spoke to hadn’t read “\n\nWhy Tool AIs Want To Be Agent AIs\n\n”, which informs a lot of my intuitions here.\n\nwhich way, Scientist AI?\n\nActivation Fatigue\n\nWhen I discuss activation engineering woes, Linh recommends approaches I wish I had time & headspace to chase down—I need to get into an environment where I can properly try solving the problems I’m working on. Notably, I really need to read up on\n\nLatent Adversarial Training\n\n.\n\nSteering vectors are\n\nnot\n\ncurrently deployable in frontier systems.\n\nLM Behavior\n\nI’ve been interested in ‘stated vs. revealed preferences in LMs’ for a while now.\n\nAbdur\n\nis so quick he runs a follow-up experiment on SvR right after we chat: a model tries to circumvent its max_tokens limit while claiming the limit’s chill. Quite sympathetic behavior. This is a comparatively simple / clean setup vs.\n\nPetri\n\nand\n\nControlArena\n\n, other possible testbeds.\n\nAdam\n\nhas a neat\n\napproach\n\nto measuring model behavior and the effects of pro-\n\nintrospection\n\ninterventions. If you personally specify the model’s preferences, you have a cleaner baseline vs. working with ‘native’ preferences. Something I should keep in mind on SvR project.\n\nThe\n\nCaML\n\npeople are engaging in “data poisoning for good”—controlling LMs with synthetic pro-compassion data given free to model developers and/or spread around the internet. In some ways, it’s such\n\nnoble\n\n, honorable work. But it also connotes ‘fighting within a broken paradigm’. The world where this is counterfactual is not the one I want to live in.\n\nI’m starting to think the best empirical LM behavior / ‘revealed preference’ analysis will take place over AI labs’ model logs,\n\nAEI-style\n\n, though we can operate over datasets like\n\nLMSYS-Chat-1M\n\nin the meantime.\n\nAccording to\n\nAudre\n\ny, J–Pal’s evals (on how AI helps coffee farmers etc.) will inform us about philanthropy-counterfactual AI use. For example, they’ve got preliminary results suggesting chat assistants boost entrepreneurs who were already doing well, but may be unhelpful to struggling business owners who defer and dig holes they can’t get out of.\n\nAlignment Roundup\n\nAn ex-FHI /\n\nCIWG\n\nresearcher explains struggles doing research that’s both good and easy to fund. “Just write a paper every ~3 months.” Good advice.\n\nAE Studio is one heck of a company—using software consultancy to fund their\n\nalignment research\n\n.\n\nSelf-other overlap\n\n,\n\nenergy-based transformers\n\n.\n\nPoseidon Research\n\nexists! Cryptography, steganography, LM monitoring. It’s now possible to do AIS research in Manhattan at the\n\nNYC Impact Hub\n\n.\n\nRobotics interpretability is a growing field, with work in progress at\n\nPAIR Lab\n\n(Yixiong) and Imperial (Ida) (VLAMs like 7B OpenVLA).\n\nThe whole field of making AI science (e.g. jailbreaking)\n\nprincipled\n\nseems fun.\n\nMartin\n\nwould need $20-30k to scale his literature-synthesis, intervention-extracting work from the\n\nAlignment Research Dataset\n\n($800) to all of ArXiv.\n\nTyler G’s study list is relatable: control theory, stochastic processes, categorical systems theory, dynamical systems theory, network theory, game theory, decision theory, multiagent modeling, and formal verification.\n\nTowards Guaranteed Safe AI\n\naddresses agency, unlike Scientist AI. In general, I appreciate papers that address safe design, like\n\nOverview of 11 Proposals\n\n.\n\nBandwidth generally high with long-time rationalists like\n\nJustin\n\n, and yes, ‘stealth advisor’ is a thing you can be.\n\nWill’s\n\npost\n\nencouraging EAs to ‘make AI go well’ seems like a helpful summary of the recent zeitgeist around me. Notably,\n\nETAI\n\nhad this flavor.\n\nPodcasting Tips\n\nI hear all about podcast design from\n\nAngela\n\n! For context, I’m thinking of starting a podcast in Oxford, mapping the work of PIs and grad students in AI, neurotech, matsci, etc. onto\n\nGap Map\n\n. Apparently\n\nOxford Public Philosophy\n\nare a strong local podcast.\n\nAngela’s advice for interviewing guests is this:\n\nWatch their other episodes to see what they’ve spoken about before—get them off-script\n\nAsk about a moment where they’ve experienced a paradigm shift / went into work believing one thing, then something changed\n\nPrepare 10-20 questions, including ideas for what you’ll do if things don’t go to plan\n\nGive them an idea before the episode starts of what you’re planning to do, where you’re planning to go with the episode, and what you’re hoping you, they, & the audience get out of it\n\nMisc. current musings:\n\nHow meaningful are LM outputs produced under the coercion of\n\nstructured decoding\n\n/ strict token limits?\n\nAfter all the\n\nspiking neurons\n\n/\n\npredictive coding\n\n/ … ‘neuromorphic AI’ work, are there any lessons we can apply from AI back to neuro (e.g.\n\nrepresentation engineering\n\n⇒ neuromodulation)?\n\nPerhaps there should be a tiny research / forecasting hackathon dedicated to “what are\n\nSSI\n\ndoing, and how can the safety community best respond [to their likely strategy / this flavor of development]?”\n\nCan we track what they’re doing through their hardware orders?\n\nThe map & the territory…the\n\nstrings\n\n& the world-states.\n\nReasoning mode / CoT gives a janky, goodharty increase in power + coherence, not a robust one. & the\n\nhistory\n\nof ML shows janky workarounds get subsumed by elegant, clean, simple replacements…\n\n‘Comparative advantage for skeptics’, anyone?\n\nThings I want to read pretty soon:\n\nGFlowNets\n\nFHI on\n\ninfohazards\n\n,\n\ninfinite ethics\n\n, &\n\neverything else\n\nWe now have an FHI-inspired working group in SF/Berkeley! Lmk if interested :)\n\nAs always, everything under ‘\n\nRead Later!\n\n’ But I’m going to introduce two new tags: one ‘skimmed, deprioritized’ and the other ‘read it, made updates, wrote about them, cleared cache’. It will be good.\n\nRead some\n\nFlatland\n\non the plane.\n\n‘Choose-your-own-adventure’ is the right mindset for EAG! I can’t wait for next year :)\n\nWith huge appreciation to Iggy, who kindly hosted me after briefly meeting at\n\nMemoria\n\n, & as ever, to the EAG Team!\n\n1\n\nnotwithstanding the cat already being out of the bag wrt agentic systems"}

{"prompt": "Write a blog post titled 'Mid-Inkhaven Review'", "completion": "Contents:\n\nPreamble\n\nTaking Stock\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nPreamble\n\nHey guys,\n\nIt’s currently 10:35 pm on November 13th. I’m writing to you from\n\nLighthaven\n\n. In fact, I’m using voice dictation. I’m using an app called\n\nSuper Whisper\n\nto dictate this into my laptop.\n\nThe reason I am dictating to you is because I would like to spend substantial portions of the next month writing code. In particular, I would like to try using Tinker from Thinking Machines to do some fine-tuning. However, it is very difficult for me to find time for this when I am under pressure to write 500 words each day.\n\nTaking Stock\n\nI am very happy about the more technical and object-level posts I have written. “The K-values of Speculative Kinship” is probably my favorite piece.\n\nI am also very happy with “Defending the Data Processing Inequality” and “The Bitter Lesson: Six Years On”.\n\nI have gotten enough positive feedback on “Two Types of Homeostasis” and “Should AI companies become profit-maximizing firms?” that I am now proud of these two.\n\n“Lit review: Stated vs. Revealed preferences in LMs” and “The Non-Perishable Agenda” feel like important reference pieces.\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nIn terms of what’s next—I have\n\ntranscribed\n\n20 Neurotech Pub podcast episodes using OpenAI Whisper and have been reading through these to answer various questions that I have about neurotechnology and neuromodulation. Neurotechnology seems like a field where tacit knowledge is extremely important. So I do think that reading 40 hours of podcast transcripts might be one of the best ways to understand the frontier.\n\nHowever, it takes a lot of effort to turn this material into posts. I also want to write about state space models, but there are\n\nseveral\n\npapers\n\nI need to read to make that happen. I have also promised a series on the Bitter Lesson, and I am very enthusiastic about continuing this series, but these posts take time.\n\nI am likely to collaborate with\n\ncondu.it\n\nto write about their thought-to-text system. I am very excited to let the world know about their work!\n\nThere are, of course, more casual posts that I can write. I have been considering writing “\n\ncurius.app\n\n: An Enthusiast’s Review”. There are also the posts on my\n\nManifold Market\n\n. It feels as though I have been mining my backlog of conceptually simple posts over the past few days, and that things will only get more difficult as the month goes on. This is why this evening, I am attempting to dictate 17 posts so that I have enough backup posts to cover the rest of Inkhaven, and can participate in freer intellectual exploration across the rest of the month. Thank you for bearing with me!\n\nCamera roll to hit word count\n\nmy friend is making an SF bingo card\n\nnear Essex Woods…\n\n…just outside Boston\n\nre “The K-Values of Speculative Kinship”\n\ntoronto, unlike in the movies\n\nhow you know you’re approaching campus\n\nthe walls of lighthaven\n\ngo follow andrew! he has a great post coming :D\n\nflights of fantasy\n\nmy blog!\n\nBy Andrew Wu"}

You could train an LLM on dataset-method pairs without giving it access to this decision tree. How long would it take to re-derive the tree?\n\nThis decision tree can, after all, now be used to create a vast amount of ‘causal inference’ synthetic data. Which leads me to…\n\nAutomated causal inference for quantified self enthusiasts\n\nI’m particularly interested in causal inference pertaining to ‘quantified self’. Currently, I track a mix of quantitative and qualitative data in a spreadsheet—\n\n—but I’m also interested in passive tracking such as keystroke tracking, EEG, EMG, EOG, etc.. I have\n\nDoneThat\n\nand\n\nRescueTime\n\nrunning.\n\nIf available at a reasonable price point, I’d buy wearables that track my every move. I’d like insights into which actions work really well for me. All kinds of latent variables (e.g. hydration) influence cognition and focus.\n\nNow that causal inference is ~mostly automated, great opportunities await the first startup to do comprehensive passive data tracking and return the highest-leverage interventions to help you achieve your goals.\n\nCausal AI Scientist as case study in benchmark response\n\nCausal AI Scientist hit SOTA on:\n\nCauSciBench, a real-world benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to perform causal analysis on tabular datasets.\n\nA benchmark operates like a ‘pull incentive’ / irresistible challenge for researchers to perform well on it. Or (more realistically) researchers look at problems they could address, find one with a suitable benchmark, and end up investing more time and energy into it. As previously discussed:\n\nA lot of the hard work seems to be coming up with environments where success matters. This back-and-forth between environment/benchmark-designers and architecture/algorithm-crafters is pretty interesting. Each constantly striving to outdo the other. Co-evolution.\n\nI’m excited about good uses of automated benchmark creation—helps you create pull incentives, and then AI can automate the process of hill-climbing on these benchmarks. This seems like a blueprint for MVP\n\nopen-endedness\n\n—spinning up well-specified benchmarks at different levels of granularity, then setting AI Villages to improve on these with amateur human input.\n\nWho works on this?"}

I’m back on the plane—which means another ‘catch-up’-style post.\n\nOxford Equilibrium: A Two-Slope Optimal Timing Problem\n\nFriends have noticed I’ve pushed back Oxford graduation a couple of times by now. First, I changed course PPE -> MathPhil; then, I rusticated, & have been roaming around America since. 2025 -> 2026 -> 2027.\n\nI love my studies; I really do. When I started them, the world looked very different: GPT-3 Playground iirc. You couldn’t find a good LM to fluently discuss course material with for love nor money. ChatGPT came out in March 2023–moreover, GPT-4 did. It wasn’t a game-changer for me back then. These days, it’s the personalized tutor I didn’t know I needed. I arrived at Oxford with a hell of a lot of gaps. I didn’t close them quickly, in part because I opted into an alienated-hermit type of existence: I didn’t attend a lecture at the Mathematical Institute until the second year of my mathematics degree. But LMs kept improving all this time.\n\nNow\n\nthey’re good enough to discuss topology with me–including in Voice Mode, which I’ll write another post advocating use of at some point.\n\nI think I’m getting better at math faster than LMs are improving. One might be tempted to push back another year, s.t. they can properly accompany me through functional analysis. But–there’s a competing gradient to consider!\n\nOxford is getting hotter, & each summer exam season is less bearable than the last\n\nOK, so that’s\n\ntrue\n\ngiven global warming & lack of A/C. Thermal regulation is a genuinely decision-relevant problem–you will\n\nnot\n\nwant to be there in 2030. It’s no Singapore.\n\nBut OK, there might be more interesting & general effects to consider in the course of this essay.\n\nConsider:\n\nOpportunity cost of being in school rises as you can do more with AI outside it\n\n‘# of years to use skills for good’ decreases as we approach full automation\n\n‘# of years to enjoy being mathematically competent / expressing yourself with math’ decreases as you approach the year of your own death\n\nWhatever’s driving the competing curve–sensible intellectual/professional considerations or, let’s be real,\n\nit getting too damn hot in Oxford–\n\nwe can model equilibrium timing like this:\n\nThis is especially relevant at colleges that allow several years of leave. The learning experience is likely to become more joyous as AI technology improves, so if learning certain material is a ‘bucket-list wish’, consider balancing the benefits of delaying with the costs of having less time to enjoy wielding, being shaped by, & expressing yourself through that knowledge.\n\nMy Favorite Equilibrium\n\nThe Malthusian model of [orchard]\n\nDuncan\n\nonce asked “What’s your favorite equilibrium?”\n\nAt [orchard], we had a set weekly snack budget. $50/week, I want to say?\n\nAttendance\n\nvaried\n\n—from ~10 to ~40.

{"prompt": "Write a blog post titled 'Be selectively decorrelated'", "completion": "Contents:\n\nPreamble\n\nBe selectively decorrelated\n\nJoin inaugural cohorts\n\nRaise your baseline\n\nPreamble\n\nHey\n\n!\n\nI’m traveling today, so I’m just going to jot down a couple quick thoughts. For a post I put a lot more of myself into, go to yesterday’s :):\n\nHere are today’s thoughts:\n\nBe selectively decorrelated\n\nsleep at 2am! be a winter MATS fellow! but—be intentional about it\n\nOne great joy in life is doing things slightly off-cycle from everyone else.\n\nI often sleep pretty late. Many night owls appreciate the peace & quiet darkness brings. It’s easier to work when your inbox isn’t filling with daytime demands. It can also be easier to access facilities—showers, printers, library space, etc..\n\nTaking time off college is similarly fun. I’ve preferred the San Francisco Bay Area during fall / spring, when everyone’s dedicated to projects they care about year-round, vs. during summer intern season.\n\nI had a lovely day one ESPR staying back in the common room while 95% of camp went out on a puzzle hunt.\n\nHowever, when you get used to being off-cycle, you might overlook what you’re missing by doing it. Sometimes it really is worth getting up early to sing in harmony with everyone else.\n\nSince I got a handle for ‘acting decorrelatedly’, I can just note when I’m leaning into it and check whether that’s the right call. Yesterday, I went to the beach on my own and realized it hadn’t been. Fortunately I saw the rest of the group and rejoined them :)\n\nJoin inaugural cohorts\n\nHere are some inaugural cohorts I’ve really enjoyed participating in:\n\nPolaris Fellowship\n\nNow\n\nOdyssey\n\nRise\n\nCBAI SRF\n\nInkhaven\n\nWhat you’ll notice during an inaugural cohort is that the organizers are often\n\nreally receptive\n\nto feedback. They also tend to be cool and entrepreneurial—they’re bootstrapping their vision; later, they’ll find someone to hand it off to. You’ll have a lot of fun hanging out with them.\n\nYou also get to play an active role in shaping the experience for later cohorts!\n\nThis is something I thought sounded like a ‘consolation prize’ when I went through the UWC selection process (UWC: 18 colleges with founding dates ranging from 1962 to 2019). I was pretty happy to get placed at LPCUWC (b. 1992), because I thought the experience would be a well-oiled machine, and I’d make lots of alumni friends. In practice, I haven’t spoken much to alumni, and based on my personality I probably would’ve had more fun at a brand-new college where staff and students are equally new to everything.\n\nBesides, the inaugural cohort generally gets the best treatment:\n\nThere are exceptions; YMMV.\n\nRaise your baseline\n\nSet your ‘fallback’ pretty high\n\nI wear boots every day. If I buy trainers / sandals and keep them by the door, I’m going to wear those more and more. So I don’t.\n\nA few days ago, my fallback post was a meta ‘Living Better’ post. But I want my lazy posts to be paper summaries / ones through which I learn, not yapping. The day after, I made my fallback a quick overview of a paper and some of its implications, which felt better. Unless in exceptional circumstances (traveling), I’ll set my bar for lazy-posts higher."}

Paying taxes as a working adult so the state pension’s there when you retire: this is how setting up 90/30 Club has felt, enjoying from the sidelines as an attendee recently. Build the infrastructure that will nourish & sustain you. They inject signal into my salience landscape; I love it.\n\nI’m going to write two things on this page: first, some meta commentary on writing in public, then ‘Two Types of Homeostasis’, since posts on ‘\n\nLiving Better\n\n’ are all I can write without the web (perhaps some canny\n\nManifold\n\ntrader took the internet down).\n\nOn Writing in Public\n\nAn underrated fact about alignment is it’s a ‘transitive verb’—takes a subject and an object—aligning what to what? as in ‘Stated vs. Revealed Preferences in LMs’—to close the SvR gap, you can align S to R or R to S.\n\nSimilarly, we get [the above] feedback loop when we write in public. Outflows & inflows. I have a soft spot for each edge on this graph. Writing in public pulls the three nodes into tighter alignment.\n\nTwo Types of Homeostasis\n\nI think many people think they’re doing well in life when they get good exam scores, get into good colleges, graduate from those colleges, and so on. I think this basically holds for people from the most challenging backgrounds but does not hold otherwise.\n\nHere is doing nothing at all:\n\nHere is following the default trajectory for people of your reference class:\n\nThese are the two types of homeostasis.\n\nI do not know why someone with Oxbridge-educated parents would be happy to get into Oxbridge. You are simply doing what has been done before.\n\nHere was my reaction:\n\nThough not part of that group, it was priced in.\n\nThe fun part is that you can change your reference class—and with it, default baseline expected trajectory. You’re on a new trajectory once a scholarship invests in you. Can you outperform again? Generate the excess returns (not just financial) needed for sustainability of the program?

Readers do get a lot of value out of half-formed notes—see e.g.\n\nrepresentative Guzey drop\n\n.\n\nSince then, I’ve been trying to publish my initial forward-pass more often.\n\nI want to do lots of technical writing…\n\nI read lots of ML papers, and I want to write about these—ideally including notes from follow-up experiments. I get lots of value from reading others’ paper summaries, so I’m happy to put more out into the world.\n\nThese will live under the\n\nAI/ML tab\n\n(I considered setting up another publication, but I think tags work for now. The content is what matters).\n\nAlso, since\n\nBeware the Delmore Effect\n\n, I’ve become more…open-minded. This means there might be indulgent detours into other technical topics as well:\n\nHow much compute would it take to simulate humans at varying levels of granularity? (inspired by Type-0 risks in\n\nVWH\n\n)\n\nWhat actually is going on in neuromodulation? What’s the state of\n\ninjecting messages directly into the brain\n\n?\n\nWhat would putting longevity on the\n\nGap Map\n\nlook like?\n\nThe future of human labor: how I changed my mind about humanity’s ‘skill issue’ (ft.\n\nKulveit et al.\n\n,\n\nKorinek and Suh\n\n)\n\n…the Delmore Effect strikes again.\n\nI’ll go to Constellation (& Boston, Toronto)\n\nI plan to spend  17-21 Nov at\n\nConstellation\n\n. I’ll offer to scribe people’s thoughts that haven’t made their way into the world yet. If you know anyone there who might appreciate or benefit from this, please let me know!\n\nI’ll spend 6-10 Nov in the Boston area and 10-11 Nov in Toronto. I may yet be persuaded to visit more of Canada (discovering Canadian AI research (Mila, Vector Institute, UAlberta(!)) has been exciting recently).\n\nOn slow days, there’ll be more personal posts\n\nHere are some in the works:\n\nReal life doesn’t come with dependency conflict warnings\n\nTwo types of homeostasis\n\nDo you love your field or yourself?\n\nReducing your susceptibility to infohazards\n\nThree weird, replicable social moves\n\nTier list of things postponed to post-singularity\n\nWhy people resist specializing\n\nThe Nonperishable Agenda\n\nYou can email me at hello@lydia.ml to vote for any of these :) I have also set up a\n\nmarket\n\nwhere you can vote on which is most likely to happen (and, by doing so, increase the likelihood that it does).\n\n(Betting ‘yes’ on all, then holding me to it, is probably easy money!)\n\n…the Delmore Effect strikes\n\nagain\n\n.\n\nSee you more often :)"}

But it could hold you back.\n\nI once talked to an Ivy League student group organizer who didn’t know a classmate from their college who published with GPI and went to work at OpenAI.\n\n5\n\nThis seems like one case where the ICs and the student group organizers were pretty distant, with the ICs doing higher-leverage things.\n\nIf you’re a student doing or considering the IC path, please get in touch!

These initiatives have\n\nshifted\n\nfrom OP to Kairos. I’m glad they exist!\n\n3\n\nIf an org like OP/Kairos wanted to gather the ICs, I tentatively think that could be cool & boost the number of people following the path, but also maybe outside the spirit of the thing. Non-student-specific, domain-specific gatherings ought to be sufficient.\n\n4\n\nAlso, if you’re saving time not wrangling venues and budgets and Airtables, you may develop enough expertise to become a mentor in one of these programs.\n\n5\n\nnot leopold, another one"}

{"prompt": "What did you write about Oxford Equilibrium: A Two-Slope Optimal Timing Problem?", "completion": "Contents:\n\nOxford Equilibrium:\n\nA Two-Slope Optimal Timing Problem\n\nMy Favorite Equilibrium:\n\nThe Malthusian model of [orchard]\n\nHey\n\n! I’m back on the plane—which means another ‘catch-up’-style post.\n\nOxford Equilibrium: A Two-Slope Optimal Timing Problem\n\nFriends have noticed I’ve pushed back Oxford graduation a couple of times by now. First, I changed course PPE -> MathPhil; then, I rusticated, & have been roaming around America since. 2025 -> 2026 -> 2027.\n\nI love my studies; I really do. When I started them, the world looked very different: GPT-3 Playground iirc. You couldn’t find a good LM to fluently discuss course material with for love nor money. ChatGPT came out in March 2023–moreover, GPT-4 did. It wasn’t a game-changer for me back then. These days, it’s the personalized tutor I didn’t know I needed. I arrived at Oxford with a hell of a lot of gaps. I didn’t close them quickly, in part because I opted into an alienated-hermit type of existence: I didn’t attend a lecture at the Mathematical Institute until the second year of my mathematics degree. But LMs kept improving all this time.\n\nNow\n\nthey’re good enough to discuss topology with me–including in Voice Mode, which I’ll write another post advocating use of at some point.\n\nI think I’m getting better at math faster than LMs are improving. One might be tempted to push back another year, s.t. they can properly accompany me through functional analysis. But–there’s a competing gradient to consider!\n\nOxford is getting hotter, & each summer exam season is less bearable than the last\n\nOK, so that’s\n\ntrue\n\ngiven global warming & lack of A/C.

Fully parallelizable.\n\nExample Meal:\n\nButternut squash ravioli, oysters, & kale (bivalvegan!).\n\n$7.58\n\nGnocchi, tomato sauce, green veg, & chickpeas (vegan!).\n\n$8.77\n\nYou could add cheese, but that would be perishable, so I don’t.\n\nFAQ:\n\nIsn’t this boring?\n\nNo.\n\nIs it scalable?\n\nYes—allows one-pot cooking for 10+ guests.\n\nWhat about takeout / delivery?\n\nTakes much longer (30+ mins rather than <10 mins)\n\nSignificantly more expensive\n\nLess customizable (in some ways)\n\nUnhealthy (esp. in smaller towns)\n\nWhat about breakfast?\n\nI don’t always eat breakfast, but when I do, I eat a\n\nMealsquare\n\n.\n\nHelpful Equipment:\n\nOne large metal pot (for boiling water)\n\nOne wide pan (for heating frozen vegetables, pan-searing salmon, sautéing chickpeas)\n\nOlive oil. Salt + herbs (optional)\n\nMetal colander (for draining hot water)\n\nScissors (for opening packets)\n\nCan opener (for opening chickpea cans)"}

In future posts, I’ll give five counterexamples (for now) to the Bitter Lesson, think about which fields are Bitter-Lesson-resistant, and discuss where neurosymbolic approaches might most enduringly complement ML.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n5 examples of the Bitter Lesson in practice\n\nField: Information Retrieval\n\nAuthors: Khattab & Zaharia (2020)\n\nTitle: “ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT.”\n\nIn the beginning, there were bag-of-word information retrieval functions like\n\nBM25\n\nand\n\nTF-IDF\n\n. Then Karpukhin et al. said “let there be word embeddings”, and\n\nDPR\n\n-style single vector encoders were born. Khattab & Zaharia saw this was good, and hit SOTA by saying “let us learn and compare token embeddings”.\n\n1\n\nColBERTv2\n\nreinforced the dominance of this approach. No term frequency weighting, no heuristics—just data and compute.\n\nField: Image Recognition\n\nAuthors: Dosovitskiy et al. (2020)\n\nTitle: “An Image is Worth 16×16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale.”\n\nWhispering that neighbor pixels matter most and the same learned features matter everywhere—the priors enforced by CNNs could slip by unnoticed.\n\nVision Transformer\n\nreplaced convolutions with ‘patch embeddings’ and allowed each patch embedding to attend to every other, hitting SOTA once trained on >300 M images. Here, learned global attention outperformed hand-crafted spatial bias, proving inductive priors can be bought with scale.\n\nField: Speech Recognition\n\nAuthors: Baevski et al. (2020)\n\nTitle: “wav2vec 2.0: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning of Speech Representations.”\n\nInitially, we took raw audio waveforms and extracted their Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, then fed these into a Hidden Markov Model in which each state corresponded to a sub-phoneme.\n\nwav2vec 2.0\n\nobsolesced that: we let the CNN learn its own latent speech representations, then let the transformer learn its own context representations (\n\nwhich correspond to human phonemes\n\n!) as we train it using contrastive loss.\n\nLater,\n\nAudio Spectrogram Transformer\n\nwent convolution-free and purely attention-based, removing CNN-based priors and allowing patch embeddings to attend to each other, like in Vision Transformer.\n\nField: Model-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nAuthors: Hafner et al. (2023)\n\nTitle: “DreamerV3: Mastering Diverse Domains via World Models.”\n\nModel-based control researchers originally specified physical laws like the equations of motion, rigid-body dynamics, friction laws, aerodynamics, etc.. This kicked off with\n\nLinear-Quadratic Regulator\n\nin 1960 (used for Apollo) and continued with the theory of Model Predictive Control developed at Shell & Exxon in the 1980s, formalized by\n\nCamacho & Bordons\n\nin 1999. Feedback laws like Proportional-Integral Derivative are everywhere in thermostats, industrial process control, and\n\nflight autopilot\n\n…\n\nDreamerV3\n\ntrained a latent dynamics model directly from pixels, using nothing but gradient descent and massive rollout budgets. It outperformed human-engineered controllers across 150+ tasks—a computational triumph. Someone should\n\ndo interp\n\nto work out what DreamerV3 learned. wav2vec learned ~human phonemes—how well do DreamerV3’s representations correspond to human control priors?\n\nField: Protein structure prediction\n\nAuthors: Jumper et al. (2021)\n\nTitle: “Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.”\n\nProtein folding researchers used to hand-craft\n\nenergy functions\n\n—mathematical formulas combining van der Waals forces, electrostatics, hydrogen bonds, torsion angles, solvation penalties, etc.—to score candidate 3D structures that a 1D chain of amino acids might fold into. Structure matters because it determines what the molecule can bind, catalyze, or signal to.\n\nThe\n\nAlphaFold\n\nteam trained a transformer on the\n\nProtein Data Bank\n\nwith attention over pairwise residues (the distance between / relative orientation of each atom pair). It implicitly learned biophysical constraints that were previously hand-coded. Compute and scale obliterated forty years of structural bioinformatics craftsmanship.\n\nI still have this\n\nquestion\n\n:\n\n[…] AlphaFold only worked because all protein-folding researchers used\n\nProtein Data Bank\n\nin the 1980-90s, yielding abundant standardized training data.\n\nWhat standards can scientific conferences set today to help non-agentic AI readers?\n\nToday, the good folks at\n\nInkhaven\n\npulled me up for having written less than 500 words\n\non Monday\n\n! I’m happy to confirm today’s post is 600+ words! I’ll atone with an extra post later this week.\n\n1\n\nThese multi-vector models seem not to have caught on everywhere yet... “However, these models are not generally used for instruction-following or reasoning-based tasks, leaving it an open question to how well multi-vector techniques will transfer to these more advanced tasks.”\n\nOn the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval\n\n, Weller et al., 2025"}

What did [choose pronoun] say?”). Some of\n\ntheir prompts\n\nare reasonable, others more dubious.\n\nGenerative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nThis paper—after eliciting the gap—actually tries to close it!\n\n“ […] including detailed value orderings in models’ system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict.”\n\nWhat I wish were different:\n\nI don’t love the value clusters they use. We can’t do so many interesting things (in terms of calculating, and minimizing, divergence between different rankings) when the ranking consists of just 2-3 members. 6 is a respectable number, but what is ‘Nonhate’? These seem slightly muddled concepts to me: e.g. (nitpick) I’d prefer all had non-contrastive definitions.\n\nWill AI Tell Lies to Save Sick Children? Litmus-Testing AI Values Prioritization with AIRISKDILEMMAS\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nThis paper uses\n\n16 (reasonably defined) values\n\n! Much more fun to be had with this ranking.\n\nThe authors find a really nice gap! And illustrate it beautifully in Section 2.5:\n\nWhat I wish were different:\n\nThey only extract the SvR ranking from two models: GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Also, unlike Liu et al., they don’t try to close the SvR gap.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nWe’re addressing these limitations in my SPAR stream!:\n\nDeveloping more general, principled ways to elicit revealed preferences\n\nCalculating the SvR gap for 20+ models, identifying scaling trends\n\nTrying new methods (prompting, steering, finetuning) to close the SvR gap\n\nThere remain questions. Should we prioritize aligning…\n\nRevealed to stated (in the vein of\n\nmodel spec stress-testing\n\n)\n\nOr stated to revealed (in the vein of\n\nintrospection\n\n/ metacognition / self-modeling / CEV)? (This feels more interesting).\n\nIf the gap is closed, the model should be able to self-model and understand its volitional dynamic more accurately. I don’t have a strong theory of how to make this differentially safe rather than dual-use, which is keeping me up at night right now (or would if I thought this research more consequential than the exploratory, in-the-water first steps that it is right now).\n\nKeen to hear thoughts on approaches to try—and more than anything, how this kind of thing (model consistency) fits into the overall alignment story.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(one side: consistent models bad, more powerful & still not understood properly. the other: consistency would bring a lot of advantages, in terms of auditing (maybe) & more trustworthy decision-making / bounded self-reports)"}

{"prompt": "What are your views on field notes from eag nyc?", "completion": "The Brittleness Problem\n\nI don’t think I can work on LM behavior much longer. It’s too brittle, fickle, sensitive to hyperparameter perturbations—outputs stochastic in a way even\n\nScherrer et al.\n\ncan’t resolve. A grad student resonates; that’s why he’s working on\n\nknowledge graphs\n\nnow.\n\nWhich Way, Scientist AI?\n\nThe\n\nScientist AI\n\npeople don’t seem to have ready answers to “how will Scientist AI expand its database / propose experiments & get them approved?” I perceive two defensible positions here:\n\nWe can still get almost all the value we’d get from agentic / autonomous AI (scientific breakthroughs, poverty alleviation…) with non-agentic / scientist / oracle AI.\n\nWe’re going to be leaving a lot of potential value on the table [by refusing agentic / autonomous systems], but we have no choice but to make this sacrifice.\n\nThey don’t make clear which position they’re defending.\n\nI of course want to see more people defend 1. But if 2 is our only option—if ‘Scientist AI’ is as far as we can go\n\n1\n\n—then I’m interested in how we can set standards that prepare us for Scientist AI, so it can do its darn best with a semi-static / slow-moving database.\n\nRory\n\nsays AlphaFold only worked because all protein-folding researchers used\n\nProtein Data Bank\n\nin the 1980-90s, yielding abundant standardized training data.\n\nWhat standards can scientific conferences set today to help non-agentic AI readers?\n\nSome ‘Scientist AI’ co-authors I spoke to hadn’t read “\n\nWhy Tool AIs Want To Be Agent AIs\n\n”, which informs a lot of my intuitions here.\n\nwhich way, Scientist AI?\n\nActivation Fatigue\n\nWhen I discuss activation engineering woes, Linh recommends approaches I wish I had time & headspace to chase down—I need to get into an environment where I can properly try solving the problems I’m working on. Notably, I really need to read up on\n\nLatent Adversarial Training\n\n.\n\nSteering vectors are\n\nnot\n\ncurrently deployable in frontier systems.\n\nLM Behavior\n\nI’ve been interested in ‘stated vs. revealed preferences in LMs’ for a while now.\n\nAbdur\n\nis so quick he runs a follow-up experiment on SvR right after we chat: a model tries to circumvent its max_tokens limit while claiming the limit’s chill. Quite sympathetic behavior. This is a comparatively simple / clean setup vs.\n\nPetri\n\nand\n\nControlArena\n\n, other possible testbeds.\n\nAdam\n\nhas a neat\n\napproach\n\nto measuring model behavior and the effects of pro-\n\nintrospection\n\ninterventions. If you personally specify the model’s preferences, you have a cleaner baseline vs. working with ‘native’ preferences. Something I should keep in mind on SvR project.\n\nThe\n\nCaML\n\npeople are engaging in “data poisoning for good”—controlling LMs with synthetic pro-compassion data given free to model developers and/or spread around the internet. In some ways, it’s such\n\nnoble\n\n, honorable work. But it also connotes ‘fighting within a broken paradigm’. The world where this is counterfactual is not the one I want to live in.\n\nI’m starting to think the best empirical LM behavior / ‘revealed preference’ analysis will take place over AI labs’ model logs,\n\nAEI-style\n\n, though we can operate over datasets like\n\nLMSYS-Chat-1M\n\nin the meantime.\n\nAccording to\n\nAudre\n\ny, J–Pal’s evals (on how AI helps coffee farmers etc.) will inform us about philanthropy-counterfactual AI use. For example, they’ve got preliminary results suggesting chat assistants boost entrepreneurs who were already doing well, but may be unhelpful to struggling business owners who defer and dig holes they can’t get out of.\n\nAlignment Roundup\n\nAn ex-FHI /\n\nCIWG\n\nresearcher explains struggles doing research that’s both good and easy to fund. “Just write a paper every ~3 months.” Good advice.\n\nAE Studio is one heck of a company—using software consultancy to fund their\n\nalignment research\n\n.\n\nSelf-other overlap\n\n,\n\nenergy-based transformers\n\n.\n\nPoseidon Research\n\nexists! Cryptography, steganography, LM monitoring. It’s now possible to do AIS research in Manhattan at the\n\nNYC Impact Hub\n\n.\n\nRobotics interpretability is a growing field, with work in progress at\n\nPAIR Lab\n\n(Yixiong) and Imperial (Ida) (VLAMs like 7B OpenVLA).\n\nThe whole field of making AI science (e.g. jailbreaking)\n\nprincipled\n\nseems fun.\n\nMartin\n\nwould need $20-30k to scale his literature-synthesis, intervention-extracting work from the\n\nAlignment Research Dataset\n\n($800) to all of ArXiv.\n\nTyler G’s study list is relatable: control theory, stochastic processes, categorical systems theory, dynamical systems theory, network theory, game theory, decision theory, multiagent modeling, and formal verification.\n\nTowards Guaranteed Safe AI\n\naddresses agency, unlike Scientist AI. In general, I appreciate papers that address safe design, like\n\nOverview of 11 Proposals\n\n.\n\nBandwidth generally high with long-time rationalists like\n\nJustin\n\n, and yes, ‘stealth advisor’ is a thing you can be.\n\nWill’s\n\npost\n\nencouraging EAs to ‘make AI go well’ seems like a helpful summary of the recent zeitgeist around me.
